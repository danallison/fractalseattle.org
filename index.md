## About

__Fractal Seattle__ is, in concept, Seattle's version of [Fractal NYC](https://fractalnyc.com). As of this writing, it's just an idea and a handful of people who are interested in making it happen. A few of us are planning to attend the [Fractal campus bootcamp](https://fractalcampus.com/) starting in June, 2025.
